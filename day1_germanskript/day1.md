## What is the programming language 'GermanSkript'?
[GermanSkript](https://github.com/lulugo19/GermanSkript) is my own created programming language that uses the German syntax and grammar as its programming syntax. It's an interpreted, objectoriented, static typed programming language with functional features which can be written like German.
